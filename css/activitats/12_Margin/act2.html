      We're so glad that our offer of UXDMC for free was so well received. 
      So many people joined up over the past 2 months and it's been great 
      to grow the community. 
      <a href="#">The Free offer will be ending at the end of the month of April and the CARE code will continue to be good for 80% off any or all modules</a>
